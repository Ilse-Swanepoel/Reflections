What's the difference between Git and GitHub?
<br>
Git is the software on the computer. GitHub is the hub, where everything is stored and uploaded. 
<br>
<br>
Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
<br>
Git is your fridge- its local and you can change things. Github is the market, you can share code, get code, its all in one area accessible to everyone.
<br>
Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
<br>
Probably, just because Hub makes sense. I wouldn't remember all the commands though.
<br>
Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
<br>
I probably went a little faster, my tracker says 30min but I'll probably do a bit more practise and I need to figure out what the cat command did. I did play the videos at 1.3 and 1.5 though because they people spoke very slowly.

Key commands
<br>
mkdir is make a file
cd change directory
rm rf is for deleting
touch example.txt makes a txt file.
cat example.txt shows all the stuff in the file
git add -A kinda saves it all
git commit -m is getting it all packaged to send
git push sends the packaged
you have to use the token password thing. You have to remember to config everything before you try and save your repo to Github. 
The folder is under Ubuntu
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepository.git
